Run this 'development' chunk

Store every call to library() that you need to run chunks line by line, as in a classical Rmd for analysis

<!--
# Description of your package

This will fill the description of your package.
Fill and run the content of this chunk, before anything else. 

Note: when you will use other flat templates, this part will be in a separate file. Do not be surprised!
--> 

# Add one to any value

This is the first tool of our wonderful package. 
You can add `1` to any `value` using function `add_one()`.

<!-- 
This first section shows:

- the three parts necessary for a package: 'function', 'examples' and 'tests'.  
  + Note that the three following chunks have names accordingly.

-->

<!--
Here is an example on how to use the function.
This should be a reproducible and working example
-->
```{r examples-add_one}
add_one(12)
add_one(56)
```


<!--
Here are some unit tests to verify the function works as expected.
-->

That's it ! This the end of the documented story of our package. All components are there.

<!-- 
# Inflate your package

You're one inflate from paper to box.
Build your package from this very Rmd using `fusen::inflate()` 
-->


<!-- 
- Verify your `"DESCRIPTION"` file has been updated
- Verify your function is in `"R/"` directory
- Verify your test is in `"tests/testthat/"` directory
- Verify this Rmd appears in `"vignettes/"` directory
